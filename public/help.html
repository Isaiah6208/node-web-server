    <div class="overview">
  
    <p> Banshee is one of the strongest 400 suits in the game, with arguably the strongest presence in its cost family due to its reloadable Beam Magnum spam.
        Because of this, you can usually solo carry very easily while playing it.  It’s very important to mention that you shouldn’t really be meleeing that much
         in both Banshee mode and NT-D mode. The reason for that is because that’s not the point of Banshee, the main objective that you should have while playing
          Banshee is to lock down the enemy team with consistent beam magnum spam.  A major requirement to using Banshee properly is being able to spam step dives very
           quickly, if you cannot do that your performance with Banshee will suffer severely.  You should use Blaze Gear and half burst
       to deal nuke damage very quickly. In this quick write up I’ll be discussing critical tools for Banshee and will leave out weapons / melee that shy away
        from maintaining a strong presence as Banshee.</p>

    <h2 class="weapons title">How To Use</h2>

    <div class="wepInfo">
    <h3><b>Main Gun (A)</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Banshee’s Beam Magnum is one of the best ranged weapons in the game due to having a long bullet size, good tracking, reloadable and does 95 damage on the first shot.
        Many people have issues with the start up time for the beam magnum itself, and that issue can easily be fixed by simply boost dash canceling out of the beam magnum’s
         animation as soon as the bullet is released.  You need to fire out as many shots as you can by inputting a beam magnum shot followed by a boost dash, while maintaining
          a healthy boost bar (around 40% is enough to stop and step dive to regain boost quickly).  Its also very important that you fire a beam magnum shot while you’re in the
           step dive animation to cover your landings more easily.  A basic routine is to fire as many beam magnum shots as you can, and then step dive backwards to do the same 
           thing again.  Your pressure should be fast and consistent.<br><br>
           
           If you’re not firing like you’re a turret then you’re most likely doing it too slowly, there should be beam 
           magnum shots coming out every single time you boost dash.  You might also wonder “what if I’m about to be in a state of Vernier the next time I shoot with my back facing the enemy?” right? In that
            situation, all you have to do is just turn your analog stick to face the enemy and then continue to spam beam magnum shots.  A more advanced tech is to just input 4/6b
             (when they aren’t firing at you, this is important) and then step dive to correct your position.    After that you can continue to spam beam magnum shots.  
             Overall, you need to be spamming the beam magnum consistently in order to maintain a strong presence, if you don’t, then your team will suffer greatly.<br><br>
             
             Thats all
              there is to properly using Banshee’s Beam Magnum to be honest, the same concept also applies to Banshee but its also harder due to Banshee’s shots being smaller / shorter length.
            In NT-D Mode, you lose reloadable Beam Magnum shots for a much weaker bullet type. It has a smaller size, but more ammo with a slow reload time. Additionally, you also gain a landing punish
            shot as a csA, but its not really reliable, so don't go out of your way to use it. Its important to know that giving up your Beam Magnum by
          entering NT-D Mode means that you will temporarily lose your ranged presence, thus putting more pressure on your partner to hold ne utral by himself more.  </p>
      <br>
    <h3><b>Sub Weapon (AB)</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Banshee's bazooka is simply there to serve as a finisher for your beam magnum shots.  If you spam beam magnum bullets and reach 0 count, but still staggered an enemy, you can use these to finish them off and get
       back to neutral.  Finishing off staggered enemies while also running out of beam magnum shots is very common online so get into the habit of respecting your sub. In NT-D Mode, you lose your bazooka in return for beam daggers.
      In general, beam daggers are good for countering melee approaches, or to simply force a fight up close. So use this to defend yourself, or to pressure the enemy by forcing them be wary of your dagger approach.</p>
      <br>
    <h3><b>Special Shooting (AC)</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> Fires a sniper gerobi that can reach enemies map wide. This can be used to punish landings at mid-range to long-range, or even as an attempt to get spawn damage as soon as the match starts.
    An advanced tech to use with this that applies to pretty much every gerobi in the game, is to look at the opposite target of the person you want to shoot, and then move the gerobi towards them. The reason
    this works is because if your desired target is moving towards their own partner, you can just look at them and immediately tag them by moving towards the direction that they're moving.
    In NT-D, this ability is simply allows you to spawn a laser in front of you that will stun any enemy that walks into it. This laser stays up for about 2.4 seconds. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Charged Shot B (csB)</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Mode change to NT-D. Simply hold B to enter NT-D Mode and change Banshee's kit. This ability spawns with 0 ammo. Banshee also goes into NT-D during Burst. Its important to mention that
      you should only enter NT-D Mode if you are either lacking a strong front line and need a filler front, or if you yourself need immediate self-defense. Staying in NT-D instead of Unicorn mode massively
      elimates your neutral game presence, as you no longer have access to Beam Magnum spam. So really, you trade ranged pressure for better self defense and more chances to make a direct play with the beam daggers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Special Melee (BC)</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Banshee will perform a melee counter.  BC can also be used as a melee extension, as it cancels from any melee during Unicorn Mode.
      In NT-D Mode, this becomes a claw grip melee attack, it can be inputed using neutral BC, 4/6 BC, or simply 2/8 BC. The way the attack works is straight forward, you will grip
      the enemy in the direction relative to how you input it. So if you do 4BC you will move slighly to the left, and then grab the enemy. Personally, I use 2BC for the hop mechanic to allow
      myself to move around and dodge more easily. You should get into the habit of using 2BC to dodge incoming attacks and to also spice up your movement. More importantly, 2BC is also good
      for quick disengages due to being launched fairly high in the air. You tpcially want to follow up with a step dive after you use a 2BC to cancal out of the claw pursuit animation.
